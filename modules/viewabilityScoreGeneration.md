# Overview

Module Name: viewabilityScoreGeneration

Purpose: Track when an ad unit has been rendered, viewed and also measure how long it was visible in the viewport.

Maintainer: jason.quaccia@pubmatic.com

# Description

- When included and enabled on a publisher page, this module will initialize and wait for the Prebid.js `AUCTION_INIT` event to occur, once it does an integration with the GPT API will be made by setting up event listeners for the following GPT events: `slotRenderEnded`, `impressionViewable`, and `slotVisibilityChanged`
  - Additionally, a hook to the Prebid.js `makeBidRequests` function will be created and get invoked immediately after the Prebid `makeBidRequests` function gets invoked
- As the web page loads, the `slotRenderEnded` event will be emitted as an ad slot is rendered regardless of if it is viewable within the browser viewport or not
- `localStorage` is then referenced to see if an entry for the newly rendered ad slot exists yet or not
  - if it doesn't an entry gets added and data is collected stating the ad was rendered
  - if it does, the existing entry is updated and the render count is incremented
- The same process occurs when the `impressionViewable` event is emitted (when an ad slot was visible within the browser viewport), except the view count is recorded
- The `slotVisibilityChanged` event is triggered on scroll when an ad slot becomes at least 50% visible within the viewport
  - If this occurs `localStorage` is referenced to find the ad slot's entry and determine if the ad slot was viewed already or not
    - if not, the time the slot was viewed is noted
    - if viewed already, the ad slot's total view time is calculated by `totalViewTime = totalViewTime + (currentTime - lastViewedTime)`
- As the 3 GPT events mentioned above occur, the relative ad slot entries in `localStorage` will continually be updated
- Viewability data is aggregated on 3 levels: `Ad Unit`, `Ad Size` and `Domain` (more on this in the examples below)
- The `makeBidRequests` hook mentioned above will have access to all created bid requests and will add a `bidViewability` object to every impression request based on the following `bidViewability` data from Local Storage (The `bidViewability` data will also be available to all bidders allowing freedom to do what they want with it):
  - Viewability data based on the relative ad unit associated with the current impression request
  - Ad size level viewability data relative to the size or sizes included in the specific ad unit above
  - Domain level viewability data specific to all ad units a user has interacted with on the domain the ad unit would/could be served on

# localStorage

All viewability data is stored and persisted in browser via `localStorage`.

# Targeting:

When enabled, the Prebid JS `AUCTION_END` event is listened for and once emitted, the following Key/Value pairings will be configured and passed with selected bids with GAM requests:

#### Bid Viewability Score

- Calculates the following for an ad slot: `viewCount / renderCount` (rounded to one decimal place)
- Example: `bidViewabilityScore=0.7`

#### Bid Viewability Bucket

- Determines what viewability bucket an ad slot fits in to based on it's viewability score and the bucketCategories designated in the config. Bucket category ranges will automatically be calculated based upon the number of categories specified in the config (everything will be rounded to 1 decimal place).
- Example: If bucketCategories is set to ['VERY LOW', 'LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'HIGH', 'VERY HIGH'] and an ad slot has a viewability score of 0.3, the logic would be as follows:
  - 'VERY LOW' = 0 - 0.2
  - 'LOW' = 0.21 - 0.4
  - 'MEDIUM' = 0.41 - 0.6
  - 'HIGH' = 0.61 - 0.8
  - 'VERY HIGH' = 0.81 - 1
- Result `bidViewabilityScore=LOW`

# Please Note:

- This module enables availability of viewability data on all Prebid JS bid requests to SSP's. Further integration to do what you want with that data is required.
- Doesn't seems to work with Instream Video, https://docs.prebid.org/dev-docs/examples/instream-banner-mix.html as GPT's impressionViewable event is not triggered for instream-video-creative
- Works with Banner, Outsteam, Native creatives

# Open Questions:

- Should there be a limit to the amount of bucket categories that a publisher can configure?
